## Overview

Trane is a machine learning library for automatically generating prediction problems and generating labels for supervised learning. Trane is a system designed to advance the automation of the machine learning process. 

In data science, people usually have a few records of an entity and want to predict what will happen to that entity in the future. 
Trane is designed to generate time-related prediction problems. 
Trane transforms metadata information into lists of relevant prediction problems and cutoff times. 

Prediction problems are structured in a formal language described below. 
Cutoff times are defined as the last time in the data used for training the classifier. Data after the cutoff time is used for evaluating the classifiers accuracy. 
Cutoff times are necessary to prevent the classifier from training on the test data.

### Main features of Trane:
- Prediction tasks generation: Trane automatically defines prediction tasks in an understandable sentence starting from the column names and types
- Labeling: Trane creates labels according to the prediction tasks, ready to feed into a machine learning algorithm. These labels contain occurrences of specific types of events in the past.
- Featurization: With Trane, it is possible to generate the feature matrix associated to the data and the labels, according to the prediction tasks. 

In summary, Trane generates prediction problems and the associated labels which can be used to create a feature matrix for a machine learning model.

```python
import trane

data, metadata = trane.load_airbnb()
entity_columns = ["location"]
window_size = "2d"

problem_generator = trane.ProblemGenerator(
    metadata=metadata,
    window_size=window_size,
    entity_columns=entity_columns
)
problems = problem_generator.generate()

print(f'Generated {len(problems)} problems.')
print(problems[108])
print(problems[108].create_target_values(data).head(5))
```
